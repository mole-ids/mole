You can find information about writting basic yara rules Syntax \u00b6 With Mole IDS we will be able to match network packets payloads instead of file payloads, that means we will need to use Yara in a different way. When you use Yara to find patterns on files you mainly define the strings section and the condition one. Well, in Mole IDS, you will need to use the meta section as well. The meta section will help Mole IDS to determine when the rule must be executed and match the defined pattern. Moreover, think for a moment that Mole IDS will execute Yara rules for a stream of data, which means it has a variable length or the order is not always the same. Extra meta fields \u00b6 As said before, there are some key entries in the meta section that defined how the rule have to be executed based on the traffic. uuid \u00b6 Mole IDS does not use it at the moment. It is there for future purposes. type \u00b6 Type of event. Possible values: alert log block Warning At the moment Mole IDS only manages alerts so the unique type that is recognized by Mole IDS right now is \u00e1lert\u00b4. proto \u00b6 proto stands for protocol and it defines either network or transport protocols. The Yara rules associated to that protocol will be elected among others to be executed when all conditions are met. Possible values: Network \u00b6 IP Transport \u00b6 TCP UDP SCTP proto accepts the negation operator ( ! ). This operator can be used at the begining of the sting and its function is to negate the value. For example a rule defined like proto = \"!tcp\" will be executed on the following protocols IP, UDP, and SCTP . Warning Mole IDS only recognize the following protocols: IP TCP UDP SCTP src \u00b6 Origin address of the packet. It must be an ip address, list of ip address or range of ip addresses. Example values: 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.1/32 192.168.0.0/24 192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2 src also accepts the negation operator ( ! ). You can use it like this !192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2 and Mole IDS will match traffic comming from any address but not from those two. sport \u00b6 Origin port of the packet. It can be a port, a list of ports or a range of ports. Example values: 1234 10:100 1,2,3 sport also supports the negation operator ( ! ). An example of using the negation operation sport = \"!80,443\" . dst \u00b6 Destination address of the packet. It must be an ip address, list of ip address or range of ip addresses. dport \u00b6 Destination port of the packet. It can be a port, a list of ports or a range of ports. Variables \u00b6 Variables are handy utility for writing more generic rules or rules that can be addapted to other environmentes esaly. Variables are defined in the configuration file under the rules section . They are basically a set of key:value . This variables can be only used in the meta section and Mole IDS has some variables already defined and they can not be overwrite, those are: $tcp = tcp $udp = udp $sctp = sctp Finally, there is a variable called any that can be used to define any soruce or destination address as wel as any source or destination port.

Mode IDS is an application that reads network traffic in a promiscuous way, that means Mole IDS can read network traffic even when that traffic is not addressed to be read by Mole IDS.

Interface \u00b6 The interface section indicates which interface will be used by Mole IDS, if the want to use PF_RING features or you can define a BPF filter. interface: iface: ens33 pf_ring: true bpf: udp and dst port not 53 On the previous example Mole will listen traffic from the ens33 interface. PF_RING will be used as capturing driver and only the traffic defined in the bpf filter will be captured. When setting interface.pf_ring to false Mole IDS will use libpcap to capture packages from the interface. If Mole IDS was compiled without PF_Ring support and you configure it to use the PF_Ring driver, Mole IDS will fall down to libpcap. engine \u00b6 The engine sections has no options at the moment, this section is defined for future purposes. rules \u00b6 This section defines where and how the Yara rules should be loaded. In this secction we defined two entry for loading the rules, one for loading them from a directory so Mole IDS will load all *.yar files in that folder without recursion. Second, you can provide a Yara rules index file and Mole will load those rules. Moreover, there is a section for the user to define a set of variables.
